<h1> Work </h1>

<h2> 
<b> HuffPost</b> I’m a news editor with HuffPost. I edit reports and articles for verticals across the website, including breaking news, general assignment reports and long-form journalism. I work with our politics, trends and vertical reporters, as well as senior editors and the photo team, to make sure our coverage is accurate. I believe it’s important to both encourage writers to dive deeper into their reporting and to interrogate society's hidden assumptions and biases. </h2>

 <h2> 
<b> teleSUR English </b> I worked as an editor for teleSUR's English-language office. I coached a team of diverse writers on how to report on Latin American news, with a special focus on progressive social movements. I edited reports and scripts from correspondents across Central America, South America and the Carribbean. As a commissioning op-ed editor, I helped to diversify our content, working with up-and-coming journalists and writers from a variety of backgrounds whose articles  were widely shared by both Latino and Caribbean influencers in the U.S.

<b> Arab Spring Coverage </b> I kicked off my journalism career in Cairo, Egypt, during the 2011 Egyptian revolution. I interned with the English-language Egyptian newspaper, Daily News Egypt, covering the Tahrir Square protests and the aftermath of the Arab Spring across the region. I also worked with Xinhua News Agency, editing correspondents from over a dozen countries in the Middle East and North African region. Later, I freelanced for the Middle East Eye publication, helping land an English-language exclusive on the Nubian protests in southern Egypt.
